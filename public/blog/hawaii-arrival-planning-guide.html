    <h1>Arriving in Hawaii? Here's Everything You Should Have Arranged Before You Land</h1>
    <div class="meta">February 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; 10 min read</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The difference between a good Hawaii vacation and an exceptional one is almost entirely decided before the plane touches down at HNL. The guests who arrive to a waiting car, a stocked refrigerator, a confirmed dinner reservation, and activities already on the calendar spend their entire trip <em>living</em> the experience — not scrambling to arrange it.</p>
    <p>The guests who arrive without a plan spend the first two days figuring out transportation, waiting for rental car lines, eating wherever has availability, and missing experiences that were fully booked weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Here's exactly what to arrange before you land.</p>

    <h2>The Pre-Arrival Timeline</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="tl-item">
        <div class="tl-marker"><div class="tl-dot"></div><div class="tl-line"></div></div>
        <div class="tl-content">
          <h3>6–8 Weeks Before Arrival</h3>
          <p>Book experiences with limited capacity: private chefs (top ones book 4–6 weeks out during peak season), private boat/catamaran charters, helicopter tours, and surf lessons with name instructors. Also lock in any restaurant reservations at high-demand spots — Nobu Honolulu, Alan Wong's, Senia, and prime beachfront restaurants fill weeks in advance.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tl-item">
        <div class="tl-marker"><div class="tl-dot"></div><div class="tl-line"></div></div>
        <div class="tl-content">
          <h3>3–4 Weeks Before Arrival</h3>
          <p>Confirm transportation from HNL. Book your vehicle — convertibles, Jeeps, and luxury SUVs are the first categories to sell out. If you prefer private airport transfer, book a car service now. Reserve any specific golf tee times (Ko Olina, Turtle Bay, Hawaii Prince book fast on weekends). Arrange beach equipment delivery to your rental if desired.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tl-item">
        <div class="tl-marker"><div class="tl-dot"></div><div class="tl-line"></div></div>
        <div class="tl-content">
          <h3>1–2 Weeks Before Arrival</h3>
          <p>Confirm all bookings and get confirmation numbers in one place. Arrange grocery pre-stocking with your concierge or directly with a local grocery delivery service (Instacart serves Oahu). Submit any guest preference forms to your vacation rental manager. Pack reef-safe sunscreen — Hawaii law prohibits oxybenzone-based products; buying it there costs 2–3× mainland prices.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tl-item">
        <div class="tl-marker"><div class="tl-dot"></div><div class="tl-line"></div></div>
        <div class="tl-content">
          <h3>48 Hours Before Arrival</h3>
          <p>Confirm arrival time with your transportation. Send your flight details to anyone meeting you. Check weather — if a north swell is forecasted, your snorkel trip on the north shore may need to move to the south side. Flexible concierge-arranged activities can adapt; self-booked ones often can't.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Transportation: Don't Leave This to the Airport</h2>
    <p>HNL airport on a busy day has 45-minute rental car lines. Rideshare from the airport to Ko Olina costs $60–$80 and drivers aren't always available at midnight arrivals. Plan this in advance.</p>

    <div class="item">
      <div class="item-title">Option 1: Private Airport Transfer</div>
      <p>A driver meets you at baggage claim with a sign, loads your luggage, and delivers you to your door. Cost: $80–$150 depending on destination. Zero friction, especially for families or guests arriving with beach gear. Lani Concierge coordinates this; we also recommend Town Car Hawaii and Cloud 9 Limousine for reliability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <div class="item-title">Option 2: Reserved Rental Car (Pre-selected vehicle)</div>
      <p>If you're renting, pre-book and pay for the specific vehicle category you want — not a "compact or similar." Upselling at the counter is how rental companies fill the premium inventory. Booking it upfront is the only guarantee. Turo (peer-to-peer) often has better selection and pricing than airport counters for premium vehicles.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <div class="item-title">Option 3: Concierge-Arranged Vehicle Delivery</div>
      <p>For longer stays (7+ days), having a vehicle delivered to your rental property is more convenient than dealing with the airport altogether. Some rental companies offer this; concierge services can coordinate it.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Grocery Pre-Stocking: Arrive to a Full Refrigerator</h2>
    <p>Grocery stores on Oahu are fine — but doing a major shop on arrival day, jet-lagged, after a 5–6 hour flight from the mainland, is a poor use of your first hours in paradise. Pre-stock before you land.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Submit a grocery list to your concierge 5–7 days before arrival</li>
      <li>We source from Whole Foods, Foodland Farms, or specialty purveyors depending on preference</li>
      <li>Local additions worth requesting: fresh Hawaiian poke from Tamura's, local fruit (papayas, apple bananas, lychee in season), Kona coffee, and lilikoi (passionfruit) products</li>
      <li>Include breakfast staples and snacks — you'll want these day one before you've oriented to the area</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experiences to Pre-Book (And Why They Sell Out)</h2>
    <h3>Private chef dinner</h3>
    <p>Having a private chef cook at your vacation rental is one of the signature Hawaii luxury experiences — fresh poke, ahi, Kona lobster, locally-grown produce, served on your lanai at sunset. Top private chefs on Oahu are booked 4–6 weeks out during summer and holidays. Waiting until you arrive means settling for availability, not preference.</p>

    <h3>Catamaran or private boat charter</h3>
    <p>Afternoon Na Pali-style sails, morning snorkel trips to Turtle Canyon or Hanauma Bay alternatives, sunset cruises with dolphin watching — these operate on fixed vessels with fixed capacity. The good operators (Leahi, Navatek, private charters via our network) have waiting lists in peak season. Book 3–4 weeks out.</p>

    <h3>Helicopter tour</h3>
    <p>A doors-off helicopter flight over the Pali, Ko'olau Range, and the windward coast is genuinely transformative. Blue Hawaiian and Sunshine Helicopters are the main operators from HNL. Morning flights have better visibility before trade wind clouds build. Weight limits apply — book early to get your preferred configuration.</p>

    <h3>North Shore surf lesson or experience</h3>
    <p>Going to the North Shore during winter swell (November–February) without a plan means watching from the shore. Going with a local guide or surf instructor who knows the breaks and can get you in the right spots changes the experience entirely.</p>

    <h2>What a Concierge Actually Handles</h2>
    <p>A good concierge isn't just a booking service — they're a local intelligence layer. They know which restaurants are actually worth the hype this season, which charter operations have gone downhill, which beach park has parking, and how to get a last-minute reservation at a place that shows "full" online.</p>
    <p>The value isn't the convenience (though that's real). It's the local knowledge applied to your specific preferences — so your trip reflects who you are, not what showed up first in a Google search.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>"The guests who have the best Hawaii experiences aren't the ones who researched the most. They're the ones who asked the right person — someone who actually lives here — and followed their advice."</p>
